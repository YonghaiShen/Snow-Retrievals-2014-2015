# Snow-Retrievals-2014-2015
Snow microphysical properties retrieved from PIP observations collected in Hyytiala on 2014-2015

The datafile is given in the Matlab format. The data structure contains snow_cm MAT structure with the following content

time: [1×3012 double] - MAT time vector
DPIP: [3012×131 double] - PIP diameter matrix, the PIP diamter is the disk equivalent diameter
PSD: [3012×131 double]  - measured snow particle size distribution (PSD) given as a function of DPIP
vel: [3012×131 double]    -  mean fall velocities of snowflakes
mass: [3012×131 double] - retrieved particle mass
Dmax: [3012×131 double] - measured particle maximum dimension
T: [1×3012 double]  - surface air temperature in deg. C
RH: [1×3012 double]   - relative humidity
N0_star_mass: [1×3012 double]  -  N0* of the PSD. In this case the PSD is defined as a function melted drop diameter, N(Ddeq)
Dm_mass: [1×3012 double]  - mass weighted mean diameter of the PSD, N(Ddeq)
IWC_mass: [1×3012 double]   - Ice water content
PSD_Deq: [3012×131 double] - The PSD defined as a function of the melt water diamter, N(Ddeq)
 Deq: [3012×131 double] - melt water diameter

The particle masses are retrieved using von Lerber et al. (2017) method. If you are using the data please cite:
